Model European Union Trento (MEU Trento) is an independent, non-profit youth organization based in Trento, established in the summer of 2015. Its members aim to organize events for young students, in particular, simulations of the EU decision-making process in close cooperation with the University of Trento (see [MEUT 2016](https://meutrentoblog.wordpress.com/meut-2016/)).

The MEU Trento Team always consisted of students from Trento and abroad, from very different fields (Political Science, Economics, Law, Natural Sciences, etc.), inspired by different experiences in youth organizations. We got together and started organizingMEU Trento and planning the activities from scratch. Day by day we got more familiar with the project, attended symposia and training sessions all around Europe, contributing to the creation of an international network.

MEU Trento is a unique project in Italy. In the next months and years, we wish to start cooperating with local associations and to promote initiatives concerning the European citizenship and the spread of European values.
