## People behind BETA Slovakia

We are a group of Slovak students and young professionals who have decided to address the rising issues of disinformation and extremism spreading among the youth in Slovakia and neighboring countries. Seeing significant, yet unfulfilled potential in Slovakia, we work towards encouraging our citizens to play a more active role in national and European affairs; thereby safeguarding democratic principles which have proven to only benefit Slovakia since its introduction. With our various skill-sets, expertise and the wealth of our combined experience, we hope to make MEU an engaging event for all of its participants with a far-reaching, positive impact.
