## People behind BETA Slovakia

In order to build a stronger European Union, we want for Slovakia to be an indispensable and active player in its politics
 
Our team consists of young, active people whose passion towards the politics of Europe and civic engagement; brought them together to establish this civic association and organize Model European Union Bratislava 2018 as our first project.

We strive to develop effective critical thinking in young people through intercultural dialogue and informal education, and thus contribute to building a stronger European Union based on mutual understanding and educated opinion. Seeing significant, yet unfulfilled potential in Slovakia, we work towards encouraging our citizens to play a more active role in national and European affairs, thereby, safeguarding democratic principles which have proven to only benefit Slovakia since its introduction.

We believe that the future of Slovakia lies in a united European Union, therefore we hope that the conference will establish: a strong tradition of organizing sustainable, professional and educational events about EU politics to achieve our goals.
