## Individuals

Our aim is to deliver an unforgettable experience of non-formal education and networking to students, and therefore, we welcome any comments and enquiries that will help us on our way. 
Please do not hesitate to contact us on slovakia@beta-europe.org and our team will do their best to provide you with a satisfactory answer as soon as possible.

## Organizations

Since Model European Union Bratislava 2020 is an international student initiative, its success depends heavily on your support and mutual cooperation of many parties. Therefore, the conference provides opportunities for companies, charities and institutions to participate in the programme, interact with our partners and promote themselves. 
For partnership and sponsorship enquiries or requests, please do not hesitate to send us an email to slovakia@beta-europe.org.
