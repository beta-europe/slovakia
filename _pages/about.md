## BETA Slovakia

Bringing Europeans Together Association (BETA) Slovakia is a branch of a politically independent, non-governmental organisation BETA Europe AISBL based in Brussels, Belgium. We aim to promote European consciousness and strengthen civil society by developing critical thinking in young people through intercultural dialogue and informal education. 

BETA Europe has grown to encompass 16 branches, all of which organise MEU conferences across Europe in close co-operation with the European Commission, European Parliament, National Parliaments, academia and local NGOs. We strive to establish a strong tradition of organising sustainable, professional and educational events about EU politics to achieve our goal. Model European Union Bratislava 2020 will kickstart this initiative. 

BETA Slovakia aims to promote democratic consciousness and strengthen civil society by developing critical thinking in young people through intercultural dialogue and informal education. To pursue these goals, we organise Model European Union 2020 to teach participants about the EU and its structure in a holistic way and to dispel any populistic or extremist myths that may circulate about it. 

Our main objective is to engage students in a constructive political debate, thereby helping to nurture a new generation of politically active citizens who have a firm grasp on what it means to partake in a civilized democratic discussion. To do so, the MEU Bratislava 2020 will be designed in a way to equip participants with the knowledge, values and analytical skills key not only to become more informed, responsible and active EU citizens but also to increase civic engagement and thus support democratisation.
