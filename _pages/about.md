# About us 

## BETA Slovakia

Bringing Europeans Together Association (BETA) Slovakia is a branch of a politically independent, non-governmental organisation BETA Europe AISBL based in Brussels, Belgium. We aim to promote European consciousness and strengthen civil society by developing critical thinking in young people through intercultural dialogue and informal education. 

BETA Europe has grown to encompass 16 branches, all of which organise MEU conferences across Europe in close co-operation with the European Commission, European Parliament, National Parliaments, academia and local NGOs. We strive to establish a strong tradition of organising sustainable, professional and educational events about EU politics to achieve our goal. Model European Union Bratislava 2020 will kickstart this initiative.
