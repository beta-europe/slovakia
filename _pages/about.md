BETA Slovakia is a no-profit association born in 2016 as a national branch of Bringing Europeans Together Association e.V. Our goal is to contribute to the development of a european consciousness among the youth and to spread knowlegde and awareness about how the European Union works and what does it mean to be an European citizen.

Our main projects are the Model European Union. We currently held MEUs in Venice and Rome and in 2018 we’ll have one in Milan. Model European Union, due to their “learning-by-doing” approach, allow participants to put into practice their knowledge and to let them develop skills that will be useful in their future career. We also offer a project for High School students, called “BETA in Schools – Insegnare la cittadinanza europea”, in which students will discuss about the European Union, its issues and its perks, through specific theme-based lectures. 

Moreover, on our website we also have a section in which our members write articles on European affairs and news related to our present and past projects across the peninsula.
