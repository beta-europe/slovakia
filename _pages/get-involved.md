## Participants

The EU's three main institutions, the European Commission; the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, are at the heart of the EU decision-making process and the adoption of a legislation is a complex process requiring interaction between all these actors. Since MEU simulates the whole decision-making process, it allows participants to choose from a variety of roles according to their interests and level of experience with simulations of European politics.

### The Commissioners 

Present your legislative proposal in front of the European Parliament and the Council! Try to pass your proposal in its original form and fight for what you believe is right for the EU! Be ready to hold your ground against the questions from the MEPs, Ministers and the Press! Did this role catch your attention? 

### MEPs 

Become an MEP for your respective country and faction, and shape the EU politics according to your position! Experience intense, interesting debates and quarles with other actors! Have your chance in the hot-seat when interviewed or quoted by the Press! Play to what you believe and leave your faction should you radically disagree with its stance! Do you see yourself as an MEP? 

### Ministers 

Fight for the interests of your country and form alliances with the Ministers of countries with a similar opinion to pass your amendments. Do not get overwhelmed by the Commission and the Parliament! Your aim is to be the big player in the game of European politics. Do you want to shuffle the cards in the EU? 

### Journalists 

Be the Big Brother of the MEU! Be the eyes and ears of the conference! Reveal the dirty secrets and conspiracies of the conference! Become famous by publishing a scandalous article! Fancy digging dirt on politicians? 

### Chairs 

Be the Big Boss of the conference and let your speech resonate in the Council and Parliament! Be the keeper of order! Do you like being an authority? 

### APPLICATIONS will be open soon! Check our website or social media for any updates!
